    "# Mini Project 2: Generating the initial filters for a CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "We are at the stage where we can look into using custom filters much like for the MLP model. However, this time using the MS Paint GUI is giving the opposite problem - for small filter sizes such as 3x3 square pixels, the MS Paint GUI is much more difficult to use and draw properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we will use the tkinter GUI that I made, which was the first attempt at making a GUI for the MLP part of the project. This time, since the filter sizes are much smaller than the size of the images, and the tkinter GUI can render at a much larger size than the MS Paint filters, we will use it in order to make the filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, the way the GUI worked was using one click to turn a zero weight into a positive weight, another click to turn that positive weight to a negative weight, and then a final click to turn a negative weight to a zero weight, which created a cycle. For better interactivity, instead I will make two click functions, one for left click and another for right click, which will save even more time."
