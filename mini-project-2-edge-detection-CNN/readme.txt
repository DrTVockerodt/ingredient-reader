The second part of the ingredient reader project is to start looking
at CNN to solve the problem, so that we can address transformations.

The standard report that is included in these folders is not done yet,
but I wanted to set up the repo so I can show employers that I have
done some work on my own.

In time, as the report is written, I will upload it here. Please be
patient.

Thank you.
